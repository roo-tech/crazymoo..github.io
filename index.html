          <h3>About Roo</h3>
          <p>
            Hello, I'm Evaristo Ramos, Jr., a multi-disciplinary creator and compulsive learner based in Guelph, Ontario. I thrive on staying up to date with a diverse array of technologies, earning me the moniker of the "toymaker" in certain circles—akin to Q in the Bond movies or Lucius Fox in Batman. My journey in the tech realm has been varied and dynamic.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the oilfield, I played a pivotal role in creating work processes and mentoring new technicians on the extensive range of technologies embedded in the control systems manufactured by our company. It was a hands-on experience that allowed me to contribute to the efficiency and innovation within the industry.
          </p>
          <p> 
            During the three years my wife and I operated Proto Makerspace in Houston, Texas, I not only helped establish educational programs but also took on the role of a teacher. From programming and electronics to 3D printing and woodworking, I was deeply involved in cultivating a community of learners and makers. This experience fueled my passion for education and community building.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, as a Before & After School Educator at YMCA of Three Rivers, I continue to foster a stimulating and safe environment for children, emphasizing a child-centered curriculum in alignment with YMCA policies. My background as a Hardware Computer Repair Technician at CSAT Solutions, Inc. showcased my technical prowess in troubleshooting and repairing various Apple MacBook models.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hold an Associates Degree with Honors in Network Systems from Mohawk College, where I developed skills in managing and safeguarding sophisticated computer networks. My proficiency spans technologies such as Virtual Machines, Networking, Microsoft Azure, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certified in Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals, Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, and Google Generative AI, I'm committed to staying at the forefront of technological advancements. My diverse skill set ranges from effective business writing to my US FCC Technician HAM Radio License (K5ROO) issued in 2014.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond my technical expertise, my fluency in both English and Spanish adds another layer to my versatility. I am not just a professional; I am a dynamic and passionate individual who seamlessly blends technical know-how with a commitment to education, community, and continuous learning. Hence the tagline you see on my site: With great knowledge come great responsibility.

            <li><span>Crafts</span> - Much to the detriment of my wife I have a whole host of crafts I am learning:

                <li>Sewing</li>
                <li>Beading</li>

          <h3>Fullstack</h3>
          <p>I am currently in phase 2 of research for an MMIP (Missing Murdered Indigenous Peoples) case mapping and database project I began during my time at Mohawk College. There as part my studies in the Indigenous classes taught by Rick McLean I began to research my ancestry and learned that I am Lipan Apache paternally and I am still researching my maternal lineage. This is important to me as I identify as an Indigenous person and I feel this is a cause where I can use all of my technical skills to give back to many communities.</p>
